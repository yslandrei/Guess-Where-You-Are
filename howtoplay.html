                The game where you are given a random location using Google Street View<br/>
                and you need to guess, based on your surroundings, where you are located

			<p class="subtext">You can navigate through the location you are given using your mouse and look for clues that might give out where you are located.</p>
			<p class="subtext">
				Clues you may want to keep an eye on are: Street Names, Road Signs, Arhitecture Style, Level of Infrastructure, Language, Pedestrians, </br>
				Flags, Buildings, Terrain, or Car models.
			</p>
			<p class="subtext">
				A common tactic players can use is keeping track of which metric system is being used. Observing the imperial system is almost always</br>
				a sign you are in the USA. It goes the same for Fahrenheit vs Celsius. Also, seeing cars driving on the left should always remind you</br>
				of the UK and its former colonies. And ... Japan.
			</p>
			<p class="subtext">
				Finally, if you think you've got the correct answer, submit it using the minimap on your right. You'll be prompted with a message telling</br>
				you how well you did along with the amount of points you've got. Buckle up now, you'll need to do this 4 more times in order to finish a game.
